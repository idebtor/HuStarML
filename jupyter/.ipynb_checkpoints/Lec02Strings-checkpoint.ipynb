    "For example, `S[1:4] == 'ell'`, and you can get the same substring using `S[-4:-1]`. You can mix positive and negative indexes in the same slice, for example, `S[1:-1]` is a substring without the first and the last character of the string (the slice begins with the character with index `1` and ends with an index of `-1`, not including it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Slices with two parameters never cause `IndexError`. For example, for `S == 'Hello'` the slice `S[1:5]` returns the string `'ello'`, and the result is the same even if the second index is very large, like `S[1:100]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you omit the second parameter (but preserve the colon), then the slice goes to the end of string. For example, to remove the first character from the string (its index is `0`) take the slice `S[1:]`. Similarly if you omit the first parameter, then Python takes the slice from the beginning of the string. That is, to remove the last character from the string, you can use slice `S[:-1]`.
